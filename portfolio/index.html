  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Jeffery Onyenwe, and I’m an aspiring Software Engineer with a deep passion for technology and how it has shaped human interaction and decision-making, offering advantages in efficiency and connectivity. In the past month, I worked on a group project that uses an AI-driven platform to track government education, deliver up-to-date content courses using modern syllabi and help students make better career choices and paths. I’m also currently working on being certified as a SWE by ALX Africa, and I also took the initiative to start my AWS and cloud computing courses online. I’m an active listener, ability to work under pressure in an agile team, adaptable to new tech changes, and a creative problem-solving skill.
My standout qualities are ability to learn fast, delivering efficient solutions and improving decision-making. I’m committed to using my knowledge and passion for creating tech solutions to empathize with the users and create solutions that resonate with their daily needs. I’d like to put my technical and soft skills, and experiences into productive use by harnessing my creative and analytical skills to foster a progressive tech setup. With my enthusiasm for technology and eagerness to contribute, I look forward to bringing my dedication and ready to tackle challenges</p>
    <p>Skills include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.</p>
